Islamic culture has given us majestic arches and soaring spires; timeless poetry and cherished music; elegant calligraphy and places of peaceful contemplation.\r\n\r\nThat we can say what we think, write what we think, without hearing a sudden knock on the door. I understand you switched venues at considerable expense and inconvenience because of unfair labor practices at the place you were going to be having this synod.\r\n\r\nI believe that we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with a road to opportunity. Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America. And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East. The Arab-Israeli conflict should no longer be used to distract the people of Arab nations from other problems. For instance, in the United States, rules on charitable giving have made it harder for Muslims to fulfill their religious obligation. And I want to particularly say this to young people of every faith, in every country - you, more than anyone, have the ability to remake this world.\r\n\r\nBut we do need to remind ourselves that so many of the disparities that exist in the African-American community today can be directly traced to inequalities passed on from an earlier generation that suffered under the brutal legacy of slavery and Jim Crow.

I understand you switched venues at considerable expense and inconvenience because of unfair labor practices at the place you were going to be having this synod. <br>I believe that we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with a road to opportunity. Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America. <br>And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East. The Arab-Israeli conflict should no longer be used to distract the people of Arab nations from other problems. For instance, in the United States, rules on charitable giving have made it harder for Muslims to fulfill their religious obligation. And I want to particularly say this to young people of every faith, in every country - you, more than anyone, have the ability to remake this world. But we do need to remind ourselves that so many of the disparities that exist in the African-American community today can be directly traced to inequalities passed on from an earlier generation that suffered under the brutal legacy of slavery and Jim Crow. And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad. <strong>You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington.</strong></div>", "tags"=>""}, "button"=>"", "id"=>"1"}

I am grateful for your hospitality, and the hospitality of the people of Egypt. Islamic culture has given us majestic arches and soaring spires; timeless poetry and cherished music; elegant calligraphy and places of peaceful contemplation. <br>That we can say what we think, write what we think, without hearing a sudden knock on the door. I understand you switched venues at considerable expense and inconvenience because of unfair labor practices at the place you were going to be having this synod. <br>I believe that we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with a road to opportunity. Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America. <br>And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East. The Arab-Israeli conflict should no longer be used to distract the people of Arab nations from other problems. For instance, in the United States, rules on charitable giving have made it harder for Muslims to fulfill their religious obligation. And I want to particularly say this to young people of every faith, in every country - you, more than anyone, have the ability to remake this world. But we do need to remind ourselves that so many of the disparities that exist in the African-American community today can be directly traced to inequalities passed on from an earlier generation that suffered under the brutal legacy of slavery and Jim Crow. And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad. <strong>You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington.</strong></div>", "tags"=>""}, "button"=>"", "id"=>"1"}

I am grateful for your hospitality, and the hospitality of the people of Egypt. Islamic culture has given us majestic arches and soaring spires; timeless poetry and cherished music; elegant calligraphy and places of peaceful contemplation. <br>That we can say what we think, write what we think, without hearing a sudden knock on the door. I understand you switched venues at considerable expense and inconvenience because of unfair labor practices at the place you were going to be having this synod. <br>I believe that we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with a road to opportunity. Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America. <br>And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East. The Arab-Israeli conflict should no longer be used to distract the people of Arab nations from other problems. For instance, in the United States, rules on charitable giving have made it harder for Muslims to fulfill their religious obligation. And I want to particularly say this to young people of every faith, in every country - you, more than anyone, have the ability to remake this world. But we do need to remind ourselves that so many of the disparities that exist in the African-American community today can be directly traced to inequalities passed on from an earlier generation that suffered under the brutal legacy of slavery and Jim Crow. And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad. <strong>You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington.</strong></div>", "tags"=>"Politics, Obama"}, "button"=>"", "id"=>"1"}
